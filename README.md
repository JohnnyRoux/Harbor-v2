# Harbor — Next.js MVP (fixed types)

**How to deploy (browser-only):**
1. Upload this whole folder to a new GitHub repo (use the web UI → 'uploading an existing file').
2. In Vercel → Add New Project → select your repo → Deploy.
3. Visit `/import` to load your CSV. Data is saved to your browser (localStorage).

Already includes `@types/papaparse` and explicit TypeScript types in the importer.
